"""
Variables are simply a way to store data. They are most often used to store primitive data

Formula to create a variable:
variable_name = some_value

The primitive data types in Python are the following:
1) numbers (1, 2.5, -4.99, -1)
2) booleans (True or False values)
3) strings (sentences wrapped by quotation marks - 'I am a string')

The most important part of variables is NAMING them. Variables MUST have descriptive names that explain what data they represent/store. For example:

DO NOT DO:
x = 3.141592

instead do:
pi = 3.141592

Also acceptable:
value_of_pi = 3.141592

Naming a variable 'x' tells the reader NOTHING about what the variable contains/stores. If we name it 'pi', or 'value_of_pi', it is immediately obvious to the programmer what this variable holds. Remember, code readability is KING in programming, and it separates bad programmers from good ones.

Another very, VERY important concept of variables is called Scoping, and it defines where a variable is accessible/visible. We will look at scoping after we go over functions. Optionally, you can watch this video to get introduced to variable scoping: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wueXfiVkw1I
